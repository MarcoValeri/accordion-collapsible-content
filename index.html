                    Yes refurb or refurbished MacBooks are a very popular way of buying a cheap MacBook. 
                    Whilst new MacBooks are typically faster, used/second hand/refurb MacBooks cost a fraction of the price of a new machine and are seen as a very cost effective way of buying a MacBook, 
                    especially as the MacBooks MacDaddy sell come with a 1 year warranty and are refurbished by a certified Mac Technician.

                    Yes of course! That’s why they come with a 1 year warranty. 
                    We suggest you only buy from a company that sells certified refurbished MacBooks, so that you know the MacBook has been thoroughly checked and replacement parts have been fitted by a highly trained individual. 
                    If you’re not happy with your preloved MacBook then you can always return it within 14 days
